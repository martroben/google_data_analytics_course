**Ride duration analysis**
tried creating a boxplot with all points - too much to handle for the computer

tried creating a function to select only 100 outliers + random values from all others.
The selection was very uneven - it looked like outliers start from some specific value

Tried to use a histogram - only has a massive peak in the middle. Have to remove outliers to get a better picture.

Tried using standard deviation to remove outliers fallin outside some multiple of std deviations.
Because of outliers, the standard deviation is really stretched out for one group.

Should use median and interquartile range. By default [Q(0.25) - 1.5 * IQR, Q(0.75) + 1.5 * IQR]  is used.
Maybe I should try to use some better way to find the cutoff point. E.g. find highest derivate between some percentiles.
Too much experimentation - settle with PDF with a rectangle showing the cutoffs.
